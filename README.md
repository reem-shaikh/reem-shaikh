Besides being a crazy cat enthusiast, I spend most of my days making art. fine-art, graphic design, digital art. I run an art store: [The Artsy Shop](https://www.behance.net/theartsyshop) and [an art blog](https://artsypoetress.netlify.app/), I also do [Quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/Reem-Sheikh-21). There was a point I was into geeky stuff like entreprenuership and building firms, infact from all the Pr exposure, I've had a Pr which turnt tech agency in the past [Elevate](https://elevateagency.netlify.app/) which then got converted into a full-fledged 360 solutions digital marketing agency [TriDigital]  (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dp7FhDMnOtcOBUdIAzYdc_0vgv0OWrp-/view?usp=drive_link).  

While I learnt coding pre-AI revolution, it taught me much on patience, perseverance and problem solving and how I can merge my art, writing and technical skills together. Although I'm also interested in automation and have created a contactless VMS QR Code based as a real time project for a gated society. 

While these coding projects are old, the process holds a special place in my heart.
Here you can check my coding progress at [70 Days Of Code](https://github.com/reem-shaikh/70DaysOfCode).

My hobbies align towards writing, I've experimented in all these niches: Business Formal, Business Humor, Finance, Technology, Psychology, Legal, Digital Marketing, Investor pitches, Documentations. I would post on wattpad, medium, pinterest and twitter. I also upload my [adventure vlogs](https://vimeo.com/reemsheikh) on vimeo which is part of my passion project. 

I also love playing soccer, you'll find my [soccer inspired story](https://www.instagram.com/p/BxrP0kbDFMZ/) published @studentvillageindia. Since I was so passionate about soccer I ended up building a custom [soccer based management system](https://github.com/reem-shaikh/c-project) as a hobby project with file handling in CPP during my senior high. I've also biult Control Framework Hotel Management system during my undergrad and I created an audio hub for my final year.
In my pursuit of experimenting, I've learnt quite alot on the technical side of things, yet to learn more.
