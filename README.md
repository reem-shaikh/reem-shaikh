Besides being a crazy cat enthusiast, I spend most of my days making art. fine-art, graphic design, digital art. I run a couple art stores: [The Artsy Shop](https://www.behance.net/theartsyshop) and [Crazy Ket Lady](https://www.behance.net/crazyketlady) which is a fundraising art initiative. You'll find my work on behance and Artpal. I would take custom fine-art and digital art commissions during my undergrad, which I've now converted to a passive income source. 

When I'm not arting, you'll find me slamming on my keyboard building websites and web apps, what can I say it's kind of like my guilty pleasure. I enjoy using creative outlets to express myself, and I have the flexibility to change my tone and style depending on the needs of the project. Being an empath and a phychology enthusiast, I'm able to deeply comprehend client's perspective and meet their needs. I love me a little challenge every now and then, it keeps me on my toes!

I also love playing soccer, you'll find my [soccer inspired story](https://www.instagram.com/p/BxrP0kbDFMZ/) published @studentvillageindia. Since I was so passionate about soccer I ended up building a custom [soccer based management system](https://github.com/reem-shaikh/c-project) as a hobby project with file handling in CPP during my first year.
